        review: "Beautiful lehengaüòç, looks exactly as in the picture, provided with an astar inside. The choli cloth is adequate, work done over it is great. The most beautiful part is the dupatta, it is so beautiful, vibrant colour and very good material used. The work done is ultimate benarsi style. I'm drooling over it. I have bought it for my haldi function, yellow and red combination will look great. Thank you Mansvi fashion and Amazon.",
